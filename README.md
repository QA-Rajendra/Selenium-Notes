🚀 Selenium Notes
✅ 1. What is Automation Testing?
Automation testing is the process of using specialized software tools to test applications automatically without manual effort.

It helps validate whether the application is working as expected by running tests quickly, repeatedly, and accurately.

✅ 2. Use of Automation Testing
Speeds up the testing process

Reduces human errors

Helps test large and complex applications

Saves time and cost in the long run

Supports regression and performance testing

✅ 3. Tools for Automation Testing
Selenium – Web automation

TestNG – Test framework (Java)

Appium – Mobile app testing

Cypress – JavaScript-based end-to-end testing

Postman – API testing

✅ 4. Why is Automation Important for Your Career?
High demand in the IT industry

Increases job opportunities

Makes testing faster, more efficient, and productive

Helps you learn scripting languages and testing tools

Opens doors to DevOps, CI/CD, and advanced QA roles

✅ 5. What is Selenium?
Selenium is a free and open-source automation tool used for testing web applications across different browsers and platforms.

It supports multiple programming languages like Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.

✅ 6. Advantages of Selenium
Free and open-source

Supports multiple browsers

Works with multiple programming languages

Large and active community support

Easily integrates with tools like TestNG, Maven, Jenkins

✅ 7. Disadvantages of Selenium
Only supports web applications (not desktop or mobile apps)

No built-in reporting (needs external tools like ExtentReports)

No built-in object repository

Requires programming knowledge

Cannot handle CAPTCHA, OTP, or barcodes

Limited support for image and video testing

Possible browser compatibility issues

Tests can be flaky/unstable due to dynamic content and timing

✅ 8. Difference Between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4
Feature	Selenium 3	Selenium 4
W3C WebDriver Standard	❌ Not fully compliant	✅ Fully compliant
Architecture	JSON Wire Protocol	Direct browser communication via W3C
DevTools Support	❌ Not available	✅ Built-in Chrome DevTools support
Browser Driver Management	Manual setup	Auto-management with WebDriverManager
Relative Locators	❌ Not available	✅ Available (above, below, near, etc.)
Grid Architecture	Hub-Node model	Fully distributed & Docker support

✅ 9. When Should We Do Automation Testing?
Repeated Tests / Regression: When the same tests must be run after each code change

Large Test Cases: When manual testing is too time-consuming

Stable Features: When the feature doesn’t change frequently

High-Risk Areas: Like payments, authentication, etc.

Cross-Browser Testing: When testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.

✅ 10. Selenium Components (Flavours)
🔹 1. Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Record and playback tool

Beginner-friendly

Runs as a browser extension (Chrome/Firefox)

🔹 2. Selenium WebDriver
Most powerful Selenium component

Used for browser automation

Supports multiple languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.)

🔹 3. Selenium Grid
Runs tests on multiple machines and browsers in parallel

Supports cross-platform and cross-browser testing

Saves time by executing tests simultaneously

🔹 4. Selenium RC (Remote Control) – Deprecated
Older Selenium version (now replaced by WebDriver)

Used JavaScript for browser automation

No longer used in modern automation frameworks
