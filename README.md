1. What is Automation Testing?
⦁	 - Automation testing is a process of using special software tools to test software automatically without human effort . it helps to run tests repeatedly quickly  and accurately
⦁	It helps to validate whether the application is working as expected without manual intervention.

2. Use of Automation Testing ?
⦁	  Speed Up the testing Process
⦁	  Reduces Human errors
⦁	  Helps in testing large and complex application
⦁	   Save time and money in the long Time
⦁	   Supports Regression and performance Testing

3. Tools For Automation Testing     
⦁	 Selenium
⦁	TestNG
⦁	Appium
⦁	Cypress
⦁	Postman

4. Why Automation is important for your career?
⦁	Automation Testing is in high demand the IT industry.
⦁	It increase your job opportunities
⦁	Makes your testing more efficient and productive.
⦁	Helps you learn Scripting languages and tools.
⦁	Open doors to DevOps, CI/CD and Advanced QA roles


5. What is Selenium? 
⦁	Selenium is an open- Source Automation Testing tool used for testing web applications across different browsers and platforms. It supports multiple programming languages like Java, python, C# etc.

6.Advantages of Selenium
⦁	Free and Open-source
⦁	Supports multiple  browser
⦁	Works with many Programming lang.
⦁	large community Support
⦁	can be integrated with tools like TestNG ,maven ,Jenkins

7. Disadvantages of Selenium (Point-wise Summary)

⦁	Only supports web applications – not desktop or mobile apps
⦁	No built-in reporting (needs TestNG, ExtentReports, etc.)
⦁	No built-in object repository
⦁	Requires programming knowledge (Java, Python, etc.)
⦁	Cannot handle CAPTCHA, OTP, barcode
⦁	Limited image and video testing support
⦁	Browser compatibility issues
⦁	Tests can be flaky or unstable (due to dynamic elements or poor waits)


8. Difference Between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4
⦁	W3C WebDriver Standard-
Selenium 3: Not fully W3C compliant Selenium 4 :  Fully W3C compliant
⦁	 Architecture	
Selenium 3: JSON Wire Protocol + WebDriver	Selenium 4 :Direct communication with browser via W3C
⦁	Improved DevTools Support	
Selenium 3:❌ Not available	Selenium 4 :✅ Built-in Chrome DevTools support
⦁	4. New Browser Drivers

9. When Should We Do Automation Testing?
⦁	Repeated Testing (Regression):When the same tests need to be run again and again after every code change.
⦁	Large Test Cases: When the application is big and manual testing takes too much time.
⦁	Stable Functionality: When the application features are stable and not changing frequently.
⦁	High-Risk Areas: When bugs in certain areas can cause major issues or losses (like payments, login, etc.).
⦁	Cross-Browser Testing:  When you need to test the app in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
